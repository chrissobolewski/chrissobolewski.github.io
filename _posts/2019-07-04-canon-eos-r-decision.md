    twitter: Why I purchased the Canon EOS R?
---

I've satisfied my [lust for a new device](https://quickcoffee.net/The-Lust-for-a-New-Device-as-an-Excuse-for-Not-Being-Creative.html). At least for now. I've bought a new camera. Against my better judgment? Well... let the post-purchase rationalization begin!

Starting with some background — just so you know what kind of photographer (I think) I am, what my use cases are, and what kind of device I was in the market for.

My history with photography begins with an old **Zenit SLR** I found in my parents’ attic. 

It's years before the digital age. I take black & white pictures exclusively, I develop films on my own, and even prints on a few occasions. I get hooked. I fall in love with **Kodak Tri-X**. After a few months I move to **Canon A-1** (to this day I believe this is the best camera I’ve ever owned), and then to **Canon T-90** (the pinnacle of Canon’s analog FD system).  

By that time my friends were already using digital cameras. Me? — I didn’t jump onto the digital imaging bandwagon until very late. Unusually for an early adopter — I waited. I remained loyal to the “old ways”. A full-time analog snob, that’s who I was in the early 2000's.

But once films and chemical reagents became even harder to come by, developing and then scanning the negatives became too much pain and too time-consuming of an endeavor, I finally caved and bought my first digital camera.

It was 2012 and my camera of choice was **Sony NEX-7**, the precursor to today’s A7 line. Mirrorless (I skipped DSLRs entirely) but not full-frame, just an APS-C sensor.

I’ve been using it for 7 years, almost to the day. I feel that now is the high time for me to move on to a full-frame camera.

This is where I'm coming from. I'm an amateur, positioning myself above entry level, but nowhere near pro. I guess that makes me a _prosumer_ in today's marketing terms. Or _enthusiast_ or _geek_. Whatever.

I shoot stills exclusively, no movies. Mostly portrait and travel, some low-light photography.

And earlier this month I’ve made a controversial—contrarian, even—choice. **I bought the Canon EOS R**.

### Here's why

Speed of **auto-focus** (at the time of the purchase, firmware 1.2.0 was out with further improvements to eye-tracking and servo AF).

Famous **Canon colors** and the way the sensor along with the image processor render skin-tones. I expect my camera usage to be 70% portraits and 30% travel, so this is just perfect for my use-case.

**Ergonomics**. EOS R just feels better in my hands than Nikon or Sony (way better than Sony). Even though the touchbar is gimmicky and I'm still getting used to using touch-and-drag AF instead of the more-intuitive joystick, I really dig the way this camera handles.

This should technically go under ergonomics, but I think it fully deserves a shout out of its own: **the control ring on RF lenses**. I love it. It adds so much to the overall usability of the camera. Plus, having a second ring on the lens feeds my nostalgia for having controls on the lens.

That’s the _big stuff_. But there's also a wide range of small delights that won me over.

**Touch screen** that you can flip out. Selfies, weird-angle shots, you name it — so convenient! And the additional protection when you close it with screen facing the camera body.

**SD card slot**. I know XQD is supposed to be better, faster, etc., but both my iMac and my iPad/iPhone (via adapter) read SD cards and not XQD cards. It's just more convenient for me not having to switch and buy new card readers.

The fact that **the shutter covers the sensor when you’re changing lenses**. I deal with primes only, so I expect to be swapping lenses quite often and this feature will save me from fighting dust particles.

**The looks**. It just looks best out of all three cameras I considered.

Overall, it seems EOS R is just **more fun to use** than the other ones. 

### Things that didn't matter to me at all

**Single card slot**. I'm not a professional photographer and I've always been shooting using a single card slot. Not a big deal. Next...

**Crop in 4K video**. I don't shoot video at all. And if I'm ever going to, 1080p is going to be perfectly fine for my needs (I think). 

**Frames per second**. I don't shoot sports or action shots, so I don't need crazy burst speeds.

### Downsides that do matter, but not deal-breakers

**Lack of in-body image stabilization**. So far, the only lens I have—RF 35mm f/1.8—is optically stabilized, so this isn't affecting me yet. But as I turn my gaze to a portrait lens—either 50mm or 85mm (I will buy one of these eventually)—they don't have stabilization. That is a valid concern. And wasn’t it supposed to be even more important at longer focal-lengths? How come 35mm gets it and 85mm doesn’t?

**No joystick**. Still getting used to using the touchscreen for auto-focus point selection. This may not be an issue later, but for now, I'm struggling with that a little bit. At times it makes me think that my hands are too small or my fingers are too short to use this camera 100% comfortably.
It also feels weird not to have an on/off switch next to the shutter trigger.

**Native lens system**. Bit concerned as to where Canon is going with their RF lens lineup. Right now (+ [roadmap](https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/features/canon-rf-lens-roadmap)), it's either pro-lenses (which I cannot afford) or zooms (which I'm not interested in). Almost no mid-range in the primes department. 35mm f/1.8 is the only lens I would consider and ultimately the only one I’ve bought. My other remaining choices are the crazy-expensive L-lenses — 50mm and 85mm, both f/1.2. While I would love an optically-stabilized 85mm with 1.4 or even 1.8 aperture.

**iOS camera/image-transfer app** sucks big time. Why is it so bad?

### One last consideration

It's important to disclose that I got a really good deal on EOS R. I bought the body at ~25% below the market price Canon asks for it. And the lens with a significant discount as well. I do believe that **at this specs, EOS R offers too little to justify its original price point**.

### Alternatives that I seriously considered (and why I didn't choose them)

There were two alternative cameras (even more so: entire camera systems) that I considered: **Nikon Z6** and **Sony A7 III**. They're both in the same ballpark price-wise and very close in terms of specs. 

I took Sony out of the equation from the very start. I've been using Sony NEX-7 for 7 years now and I'm really tired of Sony's approach to ergonomics, menus, and the overall user experience. Also, even though I know this is a minor consideration, I don't like it's looks. Or the fact that everyone's using it. 

Next, Nikon. It was so hard to decide against choosing it. Agonizing, even! I stuggled up to the very end. I tried the Z6 at the store and it just did't feel right. Even though it has the focus point joystick and the button layout seems well thought out. I just didn't _connect_ with this camera on the same level I did with the Canon.

Some reviews say the images from Z6 come out a bit sharper than the EOS R’s. There’s also supposedly less noise in higher ISOs. But does it matter to me? I’m not going to print out my pictures in large format. I'm no pixel-peeper. I need nice pictures that please _me_ and that I can share over the social media or (at best) as large JPGs on this blog or in a Lightroom album. That's it.

So other than that, what would draw me to Z6? 

Full-frame 4K video? — not so much. Ergonomics — OK, having a joystick would be nice. Lens system? Nikon Z has a relatively affordable prime-lens _trinity_ available already (35mm, 50mm, 85mm, all f/1.8). Yes, I wish Canon R system had that. The looks? Z6 looks and feels utilitarian, EOS R is just a joy to behold.

I mean, if you look at the specs and nothing else, A7 III and even Z6 beat EOS R. On a purely rational level, I should’ve gone with the Nikon or Sony (or better yet — should've waited for EOS R mark II). But the heart said Canon and the heart I followed.

In the end, all those cameras are good, all perfectly capable of producing high quality images. So it’s ultimately about what camera you're drawn to. And I felt the most pull from EOS R.

Now, I need to create more opportunities to use it. I hope to follow up here on whether this was ultimately good or bad purchase decision for me.
