    twitter: By Iteration Only - thoughts on #AppleEvent. Spoiler - don't upgrade your iPhone this year
---

The September 2019 **Apple Event** left me underwhelmed - unsurprisingly. 

In another self-own from Apple, the company hyped up this event with a line in the press invitation “By Innovation Only” - but instead of *innovation* they showed mostly *iteration*.

Yeah, the Watch is a little bit better. Yeah, the cheap iPad is a little bit better value. Yeah, the iPhones will take a bit better photos, will be a bit faster, and will have a bit nicer screen. That’s it, that’s all they’ve got this year.

But then, what do you expect from a double-S cycle? Nothing groundbreaking.

For me, the biggest news was the always-on display on the Watch (this feature alone almost got me to upgrade from my Series 4) and the much better battery life on the *Pro* iPhones (not enough to consider upgrading from XS Max, though). 

### Don’t Upgrade
Do *you* need to upgrade? Consider this: you’ll be paying full price *not* for an entirely new phone. You’ll be paying around US $700 to $1,000 for a few incrementally better features over what you already have.

Assuming you have iPhone X or XS - ask yourself is paying hundreds of dollars for just the followig worth it:
- ultra-wide angle lens
- night mode
- slightly nicer screen
- a few hours better battery life
- new phone color 
- slightly faster Face ID
- slightly faster processor
- a bit more RAM

But you already have a nice OLED screen. Ultra-wide lens has limited usability. You already have decent battery life - and if your battery is getting old you can have it replaced for a fraction of a cost of a new phone. Your current phone is already fast enough. And the new phone color becomes much less exciting once you realize you will hide it under a case the second you put your shiny new iPhone out of the box and insert your SIM card.

It's just not enough to justify the upgrade and the expense it requires. Even after trade-in.

Buy the new **iPhone** only if you’re really due for an upgrade. Otherwise, it’s much better to wait another year - 2020 iPhones [are said](https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/06/kuo-key-2020-iphone-upgrades-will-be-all-new-design-5g-and-improved-cameras/) to bring meaningful upgrades and an improved device design.

And as for the **Watch**? Series 4 is perfectly capable still - except for that not having a screen that’s always on has been a true pain point for many, myself included. But to purchase a new watch just to get that one extra feature? On a rational level, that doesn’t make sense to me.

But I’ll admit, it’s a much harder decision than passing on this year’s iPhones.

### Everything Else
**New cheap iPad?** That’s one of the best deals in tech right now. I do love my iPad Pro 10.5-inch I got on release day in 2017. It’s still going strong - and now you can have a new one with fairly similar specs for one-third of the price I got mine back then. If you’re in a market for a tablet (and don’t want to pay premium for the Pro), go for this new one. It’s a really good device that can improve your workflow (or provide entertainment - or, most likely, both) in many ways.

And what about the services?

**Apple TV+** is an instant pass for me. I may subscribe once there’s another show that *everyone is talking about*. But it may take Apple a while to get there, there’s still new in this game.

**Arcade**? I’ll try it out for the free month to see if there’s anything worth my attention. But I highly doubt I’ll become a paying subscriber. 

### Skip Year
Apple’s another mature hardware company that has adopted the *tick-tock-tock* cadence of updates. For me, the upgrade strategy is simple. I follow these rules when it comes to iPhones:

1. Wait at least two years to upgrade. Preferably three
2. If you want innovation and your phone to feel *new* for the longest time, get on the *tick* cycle
3. If you want polish and refinement, get on the first *tock* cycle
4. Avoid the second *tock* cycle at all costs. Otherwise, you’ll be in much pain when you see the new improvements in the year that follows

This one is a skip.
