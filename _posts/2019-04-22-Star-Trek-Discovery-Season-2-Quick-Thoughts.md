---

Most, if not all, Star Trek series struggled in their first seasons. TNG picked up steam season 2 and onwards, DS9 was famously dubbed Deep Sleep Nine for the first two or even three seasons. Voyager found its stride only after they introduced the Borg to the series (but that came with its own set of issues). And as far as I'm concerned, Enterprise struggled all the way until eventual cancellation.[^1]

And now comes Discovery and the cycle repeats itself. Season one was... problematic. But the second one, that has just ended, turned out to be a vast improvement.

_I tried to keep the below spoiler-free, but still - consider yourself warned, as your definition of spoilers may be different to mine._

The recovery from season one's problems wasn't obvious from the start. The first half of the season was slow and full of - what it seemed at the time - filler and tired "planet of the week" type of episodes. But as the main story arc took shape, it became apparent that even the most trivial of episodes were necessary pieces of a larger puzzle. A puzzle that unfolded in the second half of the season, as Discovery shifted gears into a breakneck pace.

That buildup was important for the entire thing to work. And it did! As a viewer and as a fan of Star Trek, it was a huge relief to see the show runners weaving a coherent, gripping story - leaving breadcrumbs and clues all throughout the season. It allowed for a great payoff.

The last few episodes kept me at the edge of my seat and filled me with anticipation for the entire week. That was the first time I felt like that since Voyager, at least as far as Star Trek is concerned. I missed it.

And the place where we last saw Discovery crew - it's going to solve so many problems season one created. Plus, _if_ the creators don't waste this opportunity, it's going to be the first time in YEARS a Star Trek series will explore something truly unknown.

I don't know about you, but I can't wait.
